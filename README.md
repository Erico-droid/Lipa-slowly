<p>The site is designed in a well structured way which makes navigation easy for the user</p>

<p> The colours of the website complement the theme of the store and help keep your attention</p>
<p>Upon clicking into the site the user is greeted with the homepage where they can get an immediate understanding of what the store is for and are presented with the option to shop now</p>

### Color

<p>After deciding on my colour scheme I tested them on webaim to make sure the contrast between them was right</p>

### Typography
<p>The hind siliguri, waterfall and roboto fonts were used for the store</p>
<p>They are all elegant, pretty fonts that suit the feminine theme of the store</p> 
<p>They are easy to read and look attractive</p>

Testing

Bugs
======

<p>When I deployed my project through Heroku, It created an issue where the homepage is able to load but you cant access any of the products pages anymore as you get a server 500 error</p>
<p>I have not been able to find a resolution to this problem</p>
<p>When running the server through gitpod, no images appear</p>

<p>Create a Heroku account</p>
<p>Click the New button in the upper right corner and select "create new app"</p>
<p>Choose a unique app name, region and click "Create app"</p>
<p>Go to the Settings tab, add the heroku/python buildpack</p>
<p>Go to the "deploy" tab and pick GitHub as a deployment method</p>
<p>Search for a repository to connect to</p>
<p>Go to the manual deploy section and click the "Deploy Branch" button</p>
